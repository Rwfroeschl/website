Exercise 1: Password validator
Create a webpage that allows the user to enter a password two times in order to validate it. Web
page content:
• Two password fields
o first to enter the password and a second to verify it
• A button labelled "Validate" that alerts one of the following messages:
o Display informative error message if any of the following occur:
 the passwords entered don't match
 the passwords are not at least 8 characters long

Exercise 2: Slide show!
Create a new webpage that has a single img tag and two buttons labeled “previous” and “next”.
Your slideshow should:
• contain at least five pictures of your choice (appropriate for class)
• cycle through all the pictures
• wrap around to the beginning if I keep pushing next
• wrap around to the end if I keep pushing previous
• force the images to be all the same size regardless of the original image files' dimensions

Exercise 3: Personal Profile
Make a profile page that is styled with CSS. Have fun with this. You can make a profile about
anybody or anything. You are not required to make this about yourself or post any personal
information online. This profile can be entirely fictional.
HTML Requirements:
• Profile picture
• Biographical paragraph
• Hyperlinks to favorite web sites
• Embedded YouTube video
CSS Requirements:
• Use all the attributes listed in the CSS section at least once
• The page should not induce seizures or headaches - in other words, mind the color pallet
you choose
• All text should be easy to read

Exercise 4: CSS Manipulation
Create a web page that have a paragraph with some dummy text. Near the paragraph have text
fields to accept the following values:
• Border:
o red value
o green value
o blue value
o width
• Background color:
o red value
o green value
o blue value

Finally, have a button that, when clicked, changes the border and background color to be as
specified. You can use either the rgb() method or a color code, but you should tell the user what
units they are in (00-FF or 0-255).

Excercise 5: Publication
In addition to uploading your code to GitHub, place your files in the public_html folder on your
EECS account. You can then access them through the URL:
https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~yourKUuserNameHere
Making an index.html
When you go to your people.eecs page, you'll most likely see either a simple file listing or an error
message. If so, you’ll need to create a landing page. To make a landing page, you can write an
index.html file.
In your index.html:
• Use links, JS, or whatever means you like to create a menu to all your other exercises
• Spruce it up with styling so it's more than just four hyper links - apache could have given
us that without any effort
